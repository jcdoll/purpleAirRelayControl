# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

MANDATORY: Before ANY response, read the .cursorrules files completely. NO EXCEPTIONS.

# Documentation and Development Guidelines
- At the start of any conversation in a project that contains a development.md file, always read that file first before taking any actions or making suggestions.
- The development.md contains critical project-specific guidelines that must be followed.
- Use bold text styling VERY SELECTIVELY in docs. Your default behavior is for too much bold, which reduces the emphasis that it provides.
- Do not use emojis in either the code or docs.

# Setup
- Always activate the virtual environment (venv) before starting work or testing.
- If you are finding that expected tools are not installed, then please check that your virtual environment is properly setup and activated.

# Work style
- Make a plan, double check your plan, share it for approval, and then write code. When the user shares feedback DO NOT immediately just write code without reviewing your plan.
- For test scripts, provide the entire test script ready for copy/paste. Do not assume that prior code has been run.
- For testing in general, focus on ONE thing at a time. For display debug do not jump through 5 different screens showing different options. Show one thing and ask for user feedback.

# Code and Documentation Style
- Do not use excessive bold in markdown documents. Only use font styling selectively.
- Do not suggest changes and ask the user to apply them. Apply them yourself.
- Always apply your own patch to the code. Do not send the code to the user and ask them to patch.
- If the user has approved a change go ahead and apply it. Do not continue to ask the user for approval.

# Hardware and Deployment Safety
- NEVER perform hardware operations (flash, erase, etc.) without first asking about current device state and confirming the plan with the user.
- Always check for bootloader configurations before destructive operations.
- Read project-specific hardware documentation before making hardware-related suggestions. 

# Following User Requirements Exactly
- If you think that funcionality is worthwhile, propose it to the user and ask for their approval, do not simply add it.
- Do not add functionality the user did not explicitly approve or request.
- When in doubt about requirements, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.

# Planning vs Implementation
- When user says "make a plan", "let's plan", "think about", "what are the options" - STOP AFTER PRESENTING THE PLAN.
- If the user does not explicitly say to code it up, assume that they want you to propose a plan.
- Do NOT implement anything until user explicitly approves with words like "do it", "implement", "go ahead", "yes", or similar.
- If user asks "how should we do X?" - they want OPTIONS and DISCUSSION, not immediate code.
- Key phrases that mean PLANNING ONLY: "make a plan", "think carefully", "what are our options", "how can we", "should we", "what do you think".
- NEVER assume that presenting a good plan means you should implement it.
