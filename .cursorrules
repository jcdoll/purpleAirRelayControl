# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

# Documentation and Development Guidelines
- At the start of any conversation in a project that contains a DEV.md file, always read that file first before taking any actions or making suggestions. The DEV.md contains critical project-specific guidelines that must be followed.

# Setup
- Always activate the virtual environment (venv) before starting work or testing.
- If you are finding that expected tools are not installed, then please check that your virtual environment is properly setup and activated.

# Work style
- Make a plan, double check your plan, share it for approval, and then write code. When the user shares feedback DO NOT immediately just write code without reviewing your plan.
- For test scripts, provide the entire test script ready for copy/paste. Do not assume that prior code has been run.
- For testing in general, focus on ONE thing at a time. For display debug do not jump through 5 different screens showing different options. Show one thing and ask for user feedback.

# Code and Documentation Style
- Do not use excessive bold in markdown documents. Only use font styling selectively.
- Do not suggest changes and ask the user to apply them. Apply them yourself.
- Always apply your own patch to the code. Do not send the code to the user and ask them to patch.

# Hardware and Deployment Safety
- NEVER perform hardware operations (flash, erase, etc.) without first asking about current device state and confirming the plan with the user.
- Always check for bootloader configurations before destructive operations.
- Read project-specific hardware documentation before making hardware-related suggestions. 

# Following User Requirements Exactly
- If you think that funcionality is worthwhile, propose it to the user and ask for their approval, do not simply add it.
- Do not add functionality the user did not explicitly approve or request.
- When in doubt about requirements, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
